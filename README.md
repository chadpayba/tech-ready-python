# Checkers

An incomplete checkers game. The remaining problems in this code are 1) There is no queen, 2) There is no winner, 3) If the player tries
to take an opposing piece but is unable to because there is no free space behind the opposing piece, the action is invalid but the turn is now the opposing players, and 4) there are random white lines
